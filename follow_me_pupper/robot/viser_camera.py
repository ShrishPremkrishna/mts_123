"""Stream the Pupper's fisheye camera to a viser web viewer, with detection.

YOLOv8n-seg runs on the Hailo accelerator alongside the stream, so the viewer
shows bounding boxes *and* per-object segmentation masks. Toggle either one from
the "Detection" folder in the browser GUI. When frames come from ROS the same
detections are published on /detections, which is what follow_me.py tracks.

The model always runs on the *undistorted* (equirectangular) image, never on the
raw fisheye -- the lens bends people into shapes YOLO has never seen, and scores
drop badly. That happens regardless of which view the GUI is showing, so
/detections keeps flowing either way; the overlays themselves are drawn in the
equirectangular view, since that is the frame their pixels belong to.

Two ways to get frames:

  picam  (default) -- grab straight from the camera with picamera2. Use this when
                      nothing else has the camera open.
  ros              -- subscribe to /camera/image_raw/compressed. Use this when
                      follow_me.launch.py (and its camera_ros node) is already
                      running, since libcamera only lets one process open the
                      sensor at a time.

Usage:
    python3 robot/viser_camera.py                 # picamera2 source
    python3 robot/viser_camera.py --source ros    # alongside follow_me.launch.py

It also comes up automatically with the lab stack:

    ros2 launch robot/follow_me.launch.py             # add viser:=false to skip it
                                            # add detect:=false to skip the model

Viewing it:
  * Same network as the Pupper -- open http://<pupper-ip>:8080 in your browser.
  * Over SSH -- forward the port from your laptop, then browse to localhost:8080:

        ssh -N -L 8080:localhost:8080 pi@<pupper-ip>

    The script prints the exact command (with this Pi's IP filled in) at startup.
