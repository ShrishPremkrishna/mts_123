"""Follow *me*: which person is mine, and how close to stand. Pure functions, no ROS.

Detections in, decisions out, so ``python3 lab/test.py`` checks all of it at
your desk.

Three jobs, one per step
------------------------
Step 3. **Which person is mine?** To YOLO every person is just class
   ``person``, so "most centred" hops between people the moment two are in
   frame. But detections arrive about ten times a second, and between two
   frames (~0.1 s) a person barely moves in the image -- the same small-motion
   assumption optical flow is built on. So the person nearest to where the
   target just was is almost certainly the target. Nobody near that spot
   means the target is gone, not that a bystander should take over.

Step 4. **How close?** The bottom edge of the box is a distance sensor
   (boxes.box_bottom). Pick the bottom edge you want -- STOP_BOTTOM, measured
   with a person standing at a comfortable distance -- and drive the error to
   zero: walk in when they are far, stop when they are there, step back when
   they come too close.

Optional Step 5. **Which person is mine, even after losing them?** Position
   alone forgets the target the moment the robot has to search. Each
   detection also carries the mean color of its segmentation mask
   (``detection.id``, ``"r,g,b"``) -- mostly the color of their clothes. A
   person whose color is far from the remembered one is a stranger, wherever
   they stand; and when the target vanished and reappears somewhere else, the
   color finds them again. Switch it on with USE_COLOR.
